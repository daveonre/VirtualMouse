README: Virtual Mouse with Hand Tracking
Description:

This Python script creates a virtual mouse application that utilizes hand tracking to control the mouse cursor on your screen. It leverages the capabilities of OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) for image processing and MediaPipe for hand landmark detection.

Installation:

Install OpenCV:
Bash
pip install opencv-python
Use code with caution.

Install MediaPipe:
Bash
pip install mediapipe
Use code with caution.

Install pyautogui (optional, for click functionality):
Bash
pip install pyautogui
Use code with caution.

Usage:

Run the script.
Point your hand towards the webcam and raise your index finger.
Move your hand to control the mouse cursor on the screen.
Bring your index finger and thumb close together to perform a left-click (if pyautogui is installed).
Key Features:

Real-time hand tracking
Intuitive mouse control
Visual feedback with landmarks
Click functionality
Code Structure:

Imports: Imports necessary libraries for image processing, hand tracking, and mouse control.
Initialization: Sets up the webcam and hand tracking model.
Main Loop: Continuously processes frames from the webcam:
Detects hands and their landmarks.
Calculates the mouse cursor position based on the index finger.
Moves the mouse cursor and performs clicks if necessary.
Displays the processed frame.
Customization:

Adjust the camera resolution and frame rate in the cv2.VideoCapture settings.
Modify the threshold for click detection (currently 30 pixels).
Experiment with different hand tracking models or parameters.
